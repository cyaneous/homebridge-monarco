Currently this plugin supports:

- Contact Sensors via the digital inputs.
- Programmable Switch Events via the digital inputs.
- Lunos e2/ego HRV fans via the 0-10V analog outputs. The outputs should be connected to the AI 0-10V pins on the Lunos controllers, *NOT* directly to the fan units themselves.
